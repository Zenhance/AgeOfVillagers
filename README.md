# Age of Villagers 

We need to build part of a game named _Age of Villagers (AoV)_. The game is about people from different parts of the world trying to build their villages. The game has a lot of features, of which you need to focus only on the village creation part. Therefore all the user stories are assumed to be of a _village editor_ user role.

A village can have several types of objects like _house_, _tree_ and _water source_. There are also several nations available. Based on the nation, the objects may look different. For example, the house of the Inuits can be an igloo, whereas the house of the Bedouin can be a tent.


### Constraints of implementation

## _Inuit Hunters_
1. The house is an igloo and looks line below:![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1958088/87903150-2644fe80-ca7d-11ea-9841-16695cfcb8d5.png)
